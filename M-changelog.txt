      AQ2: The Next Generation - M0.22  --- M-changelog.txt
=============================================================================

----------------------------------------
Changes since M0.21 to M0.22:
----------------------------------------
Fixes:
- Pistols didn't respawn at dm/teamdm.
- Votes now actually work in teamDM during play.
- Disabled config/map voting during intermission. Thus, a player could change map/cfg while mapchange.
- Crashed when client used this game-mod for demo playback.
- Now, it doesn't sound when you're zooming your ssg to same zoom-level using the lens command.
- Multiple lens command during bandage or too fast repeating could do extra annoying zooming.
- Player with last ID didnt show up in ignore menu.
- If you were killing a player only with one last kevlar shot the console message was sent to the player who hit him before.

Changes:
- Disabled 'Leave team' menu on non-teamplay mode.
- Removed spaces from demo name using autorecord.
- Changed skin _i.pcx pics back using '..' like they were. Client download code didnt like it, though it doesn't like '..' either.
- Disabled '..' in voice command.

New Features:
- 'item_respawnmode' cvar to change how item respawns in dm/teamdm. Normally item would only spawn at random deathmatch spawn.
  The new mode disables it and spawns item only if map has a spawn point for this item.


----------------------------------------
Changes since M0.2 to M0.21:
----------------------------------------
Fixes:	
- 'time' command would only work in matchmode.
- Couple of bugs that caused crash.
- Score print at end of match when playing ctf would print 0's as both team scores.

Changes:
- Temporary vote banning uses same banning list like normal ban/teamkill bans, so admins can now remove/list them.
- When temp banned (by teamkilling/vote kick), ban msg says temporary banned and how many games, instead of just "Banned".
- ammo_respawn cvar also effects to grenade respawn time.
- Changed CS_PLAYERSKINS update back for now.
- Changed 'use throwing combat knife" toggle back, seems like some player are used how it was.
- Disabled some commands when game is paused.

New Features:
- dmflags 65536 changes the weapon respawn method in teamd/dm. Now weapons keep respawnning even if weapon is in use.
  With this setting cvar 'weapon_respawn' controls the respawn time when picked, not dropped.

----------------------------------------
Changes since M0.1 to M0.2:
----------------------------------------
Fixes:
- Dropping bandolier in teamplay mode used deathmatch values for ammo, so it allowed to drop bandolier and
  still have some extra ammo.
- Fixed issues when radio death sound get played more than once.
- 'use throwing combat knife' and 'use slashing combat knife' did change the mode when it was the correct mode already.
- 3rd team in 3team mode wont allways spawn to same spot anymore.
- In teamplay when everyone is dead, round would just go on. My bug in last release :(.

Changes:
- Removed ALOT string compares for specifying model, instead added new integer for type. This should speed up little bit.
- In ctf mode, team1 players will only use 'info_player_team1' spawns and team2 'info_player_team2' spawns.
  If map doesnt have these spawns, it uses random 'info_player_deathmatch' spawn like spectators.

New Features:
- cvar 'wave_time' to specify delay between each wave commands in seconds. Default 5


----------------------------------------
Changes since TNG 2.81 to M0.1:
----------------------------------------
Fixes:
- 3team mode: third team can not be locked forever anymore
- Player can not flood sounds through menu
- Team scores reset at SpawnEntities, so you can use 'gamemap' command for 
  resetting now.
- can't punch teammate anymore when ff is off
- Changing team/sub doesn't decrease frags when hit by teammate and round is over.
- Reloading HC with single barrel. Doesn't minus 2 when only the other shell 
  is fired and you can now reload the last shell when you have only 1 left.
- Matchtime could left running if team is ready and all players is in sub.
- Getting frag when dead dont increase streak count.
- Cant drop anything when dead/spec, should fix issue when dropping weapon at
  same time you die caused 2 weapons to drop.
- Reports last damaged part as chest when hitted with knife while target was using kevlar west.
- Picking up m3/ssg didnt come with full clip when reloading.

Changes:
- radio/menu sounds use svc_sound instead of stuffing "play x.wav"
- Moved some variables to own struct, so it makes code simpler/shorter.
- Use direct path to show team skin pics instead of "../pics". This allows 
  those pictures inside pak to work.
- checking player skins for overflow
- Made some buffers smaller and using buffer safe copying istead of using 
  huge buffers to make sure all fits
- removed "use_mapvote" & "use_cvote" from serverinfo. More space for other

  When captains are using it, it will need to be accepted by the other captain as well.
- item_respawn, weapon_respawn & ammo_respawn cvars to define respawn time when dropped. defaults: item 59, weapon 74 & ammo 30.
- Matchmode support for 3 team and ctf playing modes.
